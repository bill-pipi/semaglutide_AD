Figure 2. (A) Comparison of first-time diagnoses of AD between propensity-score matched semaglutide versus other anti-diabetes medications groups in patients with T2DM and (B) Cumulative AD incidences for the seven comparisons between propensity-score matched semaglutide versus other anti-diabetes medication groups. The exposure and comparison groups were propensity-score matched for variables listed in Table 1 and the status of variables was based on the presence of related clinical codes anytime up to 1 day before the index event (the first prescription of semaglutide vs comparison medication classes during 12/2017-5/2021). Outcomes were followed for 3 years after the index event for both matched exposure and comparison groups. Individuals in the matched groups were followed from the index event until the occurrence of the outcome, death, loss to follow-up, or 3 years after the index event, whichever occurred first. Hazard rates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model with censoring applied. Hazard rates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model with censoring applied. Overall risk = the number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. DPP-4i indicates dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; SU, sulfonylureas; TZD, thiazolidinediones. Other GLP-1RAs included albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide.
